# google-bash
Simple bash command for Googling via console with Firefox. It basically opens a new tab in Firefox with your Google query.

### What do you need?
This script uses Firefox, so you need Firefox, although this will run with any browser that allows you to open an URL via terminal, though you will need to modify the last line of the script.

### How to install it?
Put the file named **google** into your /bin/ folder. Make sure that it is an executable (*sudo chmod au+x google*).

### How to use it?
Open your terminal and type in __google__ _your query here_. That's it!
